= Security =
By using Worldline Checkout you won't have to worry about the security of your client’s payment details. The integration works by redirection the customer to our PCI-DSS secure servers where the customer enters their payment information directly into our secure environment so that the web shop never comes into contact with your payment data. When the payment is done the customer is redirected back to your web shop and our servers will notify your web shop that the payment is completed.
